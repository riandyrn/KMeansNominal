# KMeansNominal
K-Means implementation for nominal/categorical dataset written in Java

DISCLAIMER
----------
This project is my assignment for Machine Learning course in my university. So the concept can be right or wrong depends on my understanding on the subject. Please let me know if they're something wrong with this project especially in the concept ;D. 

What is it?
-----------
This is K-Means implementation for nominal/categorical dataset written in Java. The idea is simple, just convert the nominal value to numeric value using its index. For example if you have an attribute named outlook with values {sunny, overcast, rainy}, just convert it to {0, 1, 2}. What if the center values is not an integer number? Just floor it :3!

How to run
-----------
It is an eclipse project, so open it with eclipse and run the project :D!

*Note: rename the WEKA.jar_ into WEKA.jar in the lib folder. I don't know, but this is because my source tree keep ignored the jar file -___-'

Library Used
------------
WEKA

Licensing
